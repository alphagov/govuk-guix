Usage: ./guix-pre-inst-env COMMAND ARG...

Run COMMAND in a pre-installation environment. This involves first
generating a Guix environment containing the version of Guix contained
within this repository. Then, using this version of Guix, create the
environment in which to use. Only environment variables that are
explicitly passed through are used.

This script will use GNU Guix from the Guix store, if you want to use
Guix from another location, use the ./pre-inst-env script instead.
